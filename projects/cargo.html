            <p class="pb-20">As the design lead for Cargo Expreso since 2020, I have been responsible for creating and implementing a new user interface for the web app. Working closely with the development team, we chose to use Oracle Visual Builder as our development platform to create a modern and intuitive user experience for our customers.</p>
            <p class="pb-20">Our new design focuses on simplifying the shipping and logistics process for our customers, making it easier for them to create shipments, track packages, and manage their deliveries. We incorporated user feedback and industry best practices to create a streamlined workflow that is both efficient and user-friendly.</p>
            <p>Since the initial release of the new user interface for Cargo Expreso on Oracle Visual Builder, the project has continued to evolve. We have been working closely with our customers to gather feedback and make improvements to the platform, resulting in a more user-friendly and efficient experience.</p>
