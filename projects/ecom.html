            <h3 class="mt-40">Product Overview </h3>
            <p class="cv pb-20">This project is about improving the Ecom Cocoa App by solving users’ pain points throughout using the product. The major issue is that users get lost and by consequence they  don't upload information or stop using the app. Ecom needed to improve its capacity to collect field data through a mobile app. Currently, they have received many criticisms from users because they cannot navigate or use the application.</p>
            <p class="cv pb-20">My Role:</p>
            <ul class="pb-20">
                <li>Conduct user research to find pain points of the application</li>
                <li>Brainstorm & Iterate multiple solutions</li>
                <li>Test solutions through Usability Testing</li>
                <li>Finalize wireframes to help development.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="mt-40">Problem Statement</h3>
            <p class="pb-20">Ecom Trading works with different societies composed of various farmers, and Ecom workers visit warehouses to collect data on the final production. However, there is a challenge with the accuracy and efficiency of data collection, leading to issues with supply chain management and decision-making.</p>
            <h3 class="pb-20">Goal</h3>
            <p class="pb-20">Simplify process to collect information address user pain points as navigation problems of double forms for the same information</p>
            <ul>
                <li>User-centered design: incorporating feedback from Ecom workers to ensure that it meets their needs and is easy to use.</li>
                <li>Simple and intuitive interface: The interface of the digital tool should be simple and intuitive, with clear labels, easy-to-understand icons, and logical navigation.
                </li>
                <li>Mobile-friendly design: mobile-first principles in mind, with a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
                </li>
                <li>Feedback mechanisms: The app should provide Ecom workers with feedback and notifications to ensure that they are aware of any errors or issues in the data collection process.
                </li>
                <li>User training and support: The app should include training and support resources, such as user guides and video tutorials, to help Ecom workers understand how to use the tool and troubleshoot any issues.
                </li>
                <li>Offline capabilities: Field data collection often takes place in areas with limited or no internet connectivity. Therefore, the app should include offline capabilities that allow users to collect and store data locally, with the option to sync data when an internet connection is available.
                </li>

            <ul>
                <li>Improved data accuracy: The user-friendly and standardized design of the app can improve the accuracy of data collection, ensuring that data is consistent, reliable, and up-to-date. This can lead to better decision-making and supply chain management.</li>
                <li>Increased efficiency: The new design increased efficiency in data collection, reducing the time and effort required for Ecom workers to collect and report data. This helped to streamline the supply chain and reduce delays in processing and shipping crops.
                </li>
                <li>Better user experience: By incorporating user-centered design principles, the new digital tool provided Ecom workers with a better user experience, making it easier and more intuitive to collect and report data.
